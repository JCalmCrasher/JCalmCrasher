## Hey there, I'm JoshX ✌️️️
I'm a Software Developer 👨🏼‍💻 building next gen solutions, I mean Amazon, Google...just kidding 🌒.

I've been talking to my computer 💻 for some time(Since 2015).

I currently work as a Web Dev, building performant softwares. I [write](https://hashnode.com/@joshdev) too.

I'm also obsessed about knowledge, always trying to learn somethin' new and try to help people any way I can.

I'm currently testing the waters on open-sourcing (heard it's cool yea 😉) and tryin to overcome [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).
